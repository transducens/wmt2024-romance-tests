# wmt2024-romance-tests
This repository containing the test file for the WMT24 Shared Task [Translation into Low-Resource Languages of Spain](https://www2.statmt.org/wmt24/romance-task.html).

The file [romance2024.test.zip](https://github.com/transducens/wmt2024-romance-tests/raw/main/romance2024.test.zip) contains the source language sentences for the translation task. These sentences correspond to the Spanish version of the [FLORES+](https://github.com/openlanguagedata/flores) devtest.

As in the original FLORES+ repository, the file is provided compressed (password: `multilingual machine translation`) to prevent it from being automatically crawled and added to training datasets.
